## Robust Consensus in Ranking Data Analysis: Definitions, Properties and Computational Issues

#### What is this repo?
This repository contains the code for the paper "Robust Consensus in Ranking Data Analysis:
Definitions, Properties and Computational Issues" currently submitted at ICML.

#### Where to go
The plots in the paper can be obtain by running the code in the two Jupyter Notebooks:

1) Figures 1, 2 and 4 can be generated using "theoretical_bounds_and_exp_comparisons.ipynb"
2) Figure 5 can be generated using "loss_robustness_tradeoff.ipynb"

#### Directives to use the repo
Only the two Jupyter Notebook should be used or modified. At the begining of each notebook there is a small explanation about the effects of the cells. Generally, the notebooks start with loeading important packages and defining functions. After that, the cells run the experiments: some cells load results, and other outputs plots.
